This repository is meant to make the analysis of data used for Sp(4) fermions in the 
2-antisymmetric representation on GRID.

There are two main directories: the first one is called 'analysis_code', which contains
all the codes that has been used to analyse data presented in the paper to be
uploaded on the arXiv about this subject. Most of these codes are meant to give exactly
the output file that can be then plotted.

The second directory is called 'plots' and contains the data that have been used in 
the plots shown in the papers, togheter with the codes that plot them exactly as they
are in the paper. This directory contains also how the plots are expected to look 
(pdf files) and old codes used to develop the current ones). These files, are ready
to be ran in the directory 'plots/codes', to obtain plots  as they are presented in
the paper.
